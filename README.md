Title: Gene Expression Analysis of Alzheimer’s-Related Genes Across Disease Stages Using Python-Based Visualization
Team: Nada Khalifi, Kashfia Raisa
Question: How does the expression of key Alzheimer’s-related genes (APP, BACE1, CLU, MAPT, PSEN1, and TREM2) vary across different stages of Alzheimer’s disease, and what insights can stage-specific transcriptional patterns provide about disease progression?
Dataset: Publicly available gene expression dataset curated for Alzheimer’s disease.
